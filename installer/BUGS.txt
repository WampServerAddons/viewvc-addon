Current bugs in the installer

* currently only Subversion support tested/supported

* config files may be version specific or by branch (1.0.x vs 1.1.x)

* alias files contain a reference to the VIEWVC_VERSION hard coded. this needs to be more generic

* SQL/query support, pygments/other optional features/dependancies

* test with 1.0.x and 1.1.x branches and possibly nightlies

* mod_python and mod_wsgi not implemented yet. only running viewvc as cgi

* no uninstaller
